"2016-03-17 17:00:40 +0000","Add data migration to fix Edition.need_ids.  Recent changes to Rails have made it so that calling `Edition#need_ids` will automatically rewrite it.

A quick solution is to simply `NULL`ify the relevant column.

We've recently received reports about a significant number of false positives, where the user hasn't made any changes on the form but has still been warned ""You have unsaved changes..."" when navigating away from the page.  I managed to reproduce the bug on production, preview and in my development environment without trying. During my poking around, the only difference between the two form states was the value of the `authenticity_token` hidden input field.

This is the code that is doing it: > https://github.com/rails/jquery-rails/blob/v3.0.4/vendor/assets/javascripts/jquery_ujs.js#L386-L391 > Not sure why they would be different though.

"2015-01-26 16:37:11 +0000","Fix issue with invalid AttachmentData  The upgrade to Rails 4 broke mass-assignment of FileAttachments whilst the associated Attachment file was awaiting virus scanning. The fix is to ensure that an AttachmentData record will still be valid whilst awaiting virus scanning.  This change is required because ActiveRecord now loads the associated AttachmentData *before* it checks if the nested attributes should be assigned or rejected because of the reject_if proc. This made the FileAttachment invalid for newly-uploaded FilAttachments that are still awaiting virus scanning because of the presence check on the AttachmentData `file` attribute.","2509","147863","80037","28631","15268","12703","9706"
"2015-01-20 10:22:20 +0000","Use patched globalize gem  A change made to the globalize gem that made the belongs_to association on the Translation model ""touch"" the owning translated model[1]. This causes issues when trying to destroy translated instances that are using Rails' optimistic locking: When destroying a translated instance, the associated translations are destroyed first, which ""touch""es the owning instance (incrementing the lock_version), making the in-memory lock_version out-of-date, resulting in the destroy failing with a ActiveRecord::StaleObject error.  This is ultimately a bug in ActiveRecord (it should be able to cope with such a configuration), but fixing it is non-trivial. For now use a forked version of globalize that does not touch the association, as this isn't needed in whitehall (it was introduced to invalidate timestamp-based cache keys when a translation is destroyed on a model).

This is for https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/77617490  Since the Land Registry transitioned, we've seen a sharp and significant increase in the number of search results which get no result clicks. Also, analytics shows that lots of fairly generic searches are being performed from land-registry pages (eg, for terms such as ""portal"" and ""forms"").  Our hypothesis is that these are searches from people who have been redirected from the old site, and that these searches have a high expectation that searches will be across Land Registry content.  We want to deploy a change now to filter the results accordingly.  The results page will open with the ""Organisations"" filter box expanded, and the ""land-registry"" organisation selected (and at the top of the list of organisations in the filter box).  We'll then track the analytics to see if this scope works well in this case, with a view to scoping or biasing the search results from more organisation pages in future.","2384","146726","75585","32377","15003","12609","9696"

This removes any knowledge of the users publishing permissions from the Edition model as we can rely on the controller to guard based on permissions.  The one exception was the permission on publishing a scheduled edition. This is what guards that only the scheduled publishing robot can publish scheduled editions. I've updated the EditionRules to reflect this.  NOTE: There is work remaining here and that is to prise apart publishing and force publishing so that they are separate transitions rather than force publishing being an option that is passed to the publish_as method. This is so that we can have separate Edition#can_publish? and  Edition#can_force_publish? to verify that the edition is in an appropriate state to perform the action","2264","141371","71290","28966","13771","11532","9170"

Adds a new unit test to check that publications can no longer be published without an attachment (no html_version or attachments).  The factory for publications in the test suite now includes an html_version so that publications it creates will continue to be valid for publishing. * The 'build' strategy should avoid an extra write to the database that   would slow our tests down.  Fix tests for optional html attachments. * Adds a without_html_version trait to allow reversing of the new   default behaviour of the factory. * Uses this trait to fix the two tests that rely on a lack of html_version  Fix test for new html version slug * Requirement for an attachment for published versions breaks this test. * This has been fixed by starting with a normal attachment and then   swapping it for an html attachment.  Removes the redundant publication trait with_html_version as this is no longer necessary given the publication factory now always adds an html_version.  Fixes and decouples the html slug test * The test was coupled to the title of the html set by the factory. This   patch breaks that dependency by setting the title explicitly. * This test was broken as the title in the (now removed)   with_html_version trait was different to the title in the html_version   factory that is now used instead.  Remove dependency on html trait in test ""should destroy html version when all fields are blank"" * This test is called for both consultation and publication; the trait no   longer exists for publication. * Replaced the trait with an explicit addition of an html version.  Cucumber fix - add html version to publication * Some of the cucumber tests publish publications as part of their steps;   this was broken by the requirement for an attachment on a publication. * This patch fills in an html version when filling in the publication form.  Cucumber fix - add an html version to test import data * The cucumber test ""Scenario: Force publishing a successful import after   speed-tagging"" was failing as the data supplied in the step did not have   any attachments. * As discussed with Robin the importer should enforce the same rules as   everything else so imported data will be expected to be valid. As   such the example data has been modified in this patch to included an   html version to make it valid.","2639","135015","74443","22474","13564","10777","7445"

BulkUpload is used in two scenarios:  1. When we've just unzipped a zip file and need to render a form, asking the    user to specify metadata for those attachments, and  2. When the user has just filled in a form with all these attachments which    generates a nested attributes compliant hash of attachment/attachment_data    parameters.  In (1) we take a list of filenames and hand it to the BulkUpload.from_files method. It'll find any existing attachments on the edition that have the same filename, take care of marking old attachments (with the same filename) as being replaced by this new attachment, and build new Attachment instances for any files that haven't previously been attached to this edition.  In (2) the rules are different; we'll have a hash of attributes for multiple attachments, in the format that Rails uses when you use nested attributes in Rails. We assign this hash to the (publicly accessible property) `attachments_attributes`. While we might like to pass the hash into a method named of our own choosing (e.g. `bulk_upload.set_attachments(attrs)`) we're stuck with saying `bulk_upload.attachments_attributes = attrs`. Why? Well, if we were to delete the `attachments_attributes=` method Rails will generate a form that will break Rack's parser when we submit it.  It's ""The Rails Way"" (TM), or the highway.","2628","135043","74546","22474","13811","10593","7335"

However, after discussion with Pete, I've made the behaviour for statistical data sets the same.  The latter made things a bit awkward in the controller test, because by default all the tests were creating editions that were inaccessible. I got round this by defining `StatisticalDataSet#access_limited_by_default?` and stubbing this in the setup to return `false`.

This was previously reverted as the data migration didn't run and we didn't want it holding up the deploy + data migration procedure.  I've made a couple of changes to the script as it stood:  * Fixed a problem where the script was trying to use the `url` variable   but it wasn't in scope at the time it was being used.  * Restricted the set of files we're checking for missing attachments   to those that we've already imported in production.  * Attempt to find the edition first by going through the attachments and   then through the DocumentSource.

"2012-07-04 18:40:12 +0100","Clean assets before running tests.  We've been seeing intermittent failures in our Specialist Guide javascript tests when running under Jenkins.  I think the problem is being caused by the pre-compiled assets hanging around from a previous run.  This is the sequence of events that I think explains the problem we're seeing.  * Code pushed to Jenkins, all tests pass and the assets are compiled. * A change is made to the assets, the code is pushed and a javascript   test fails because it's using the old assets.  Importantly - the new   assets aren't compiled because that only happens if all the tests   pass successfully. * We comment out the 'failing' test, push to Jenkins, all tests pass and   the new assets are compiled. * We re-enable the test and see it pass on Jenkins. * As soon as we make another change to the assets we're right back at   step 1.  So, cleaning the precompiled assets before running the tests should mean that we're always using the most recent assets that we're expecting.  *NOTE* I've renamed PRECOMPILING_ASSETS to the more generic SKIP_OBSERVERS_FOR_ASSET_TASKS as it's now being used when precompiling *and* cleaning assets.","965","41424","22934","33","4832","3307","4924"

"2012-05-30 12:50:39 +0100","Remove custom admin show templates for speech & consultation response.  Having a single show template has a number of benefits which I believe outweigh the additional complexity of conditional within that template.  The principle benefit is that all edition types will benefit from any common workflow/attribute changes (such as the audit history) automatically, unless they specifically opt out. Previous to this commit, version history was not visible for speeches, for example.  A secondary benefit is that improvements to the layout of the admin preview will also be shared across all edition types. This is something I'm considering independently.  Finally, I think it might be true that removing conditionals in templates in this way results in more tests; if there's only a single generic show template, then we might be able to test it once, rather than exercising it through all the various `Admin::EditionController` subclasses using shared tests.","902","34226","20943","30","4083","5612","3118"

I've changed this to no longer search for the root; instead the first organisation is chosen.  This means that documents belonging to 'child' organisations may not have a background colour yet, but these can easily be added to the css if required.  There was no guarantee that even 'root' organisations had colours assigned, and most publications belong to 'root' organisation, so this is only a minor regression.  The second change is in the way the thumbnail image is chosen.  It previously used a special scope to find the first PDF attachment and using that.  Now this filtering is done in ruby, allowing us to `include` the attachments association (and thereby avoid the n+1).","869","33018","20480","30","4084","4797","3187"

The problem occurred when creating a publication with an attachment where the attachment failed validation.  After lots of digging we've determined that by overriding `#full_original_filename` (as well as `#full_filename`) we can get CarrierWave to do the right thing (i.e correctly generate our thumbnail when the attachment uses the file cache). We've added two tests that demonstrate the broken behaviour without the implementation of `#full_original_filename`.  We've also fixed a secondary problem whereby the previous implementation of `#get_first_page_as_png` caused two thumbnail_ files to be generated - the first was the version that CarrierWave creates by default when any version is declared, and the second was the from our use of the `convert` command.","728","26192","16536","27","2949","3654","2600"

"2011-10-25 12:11:49 +0100","Use url and filename to generate attachment links.  There seems to be an issue in carrierwave where after reloading the attachment model, the filename is lost.  It is apparently recommended to mount the attachment onto an attribute with a different name than the active record attribute name (hence carrierwave file), but even doing this didn't totally fix the problem, so have had to resort to writing our own filename method.","320","9267","5390","30","1103","1397","923"

"2011-10-16 13:32:20 +0100","People only care if a policy doesn't apply to their nation.  With this in mind, it's probably going to make sense to invert the relationship between policies and nations, such that a record linking the two implies that the policy does not apply.","210","5641","3535","30","723","1230","46"

"2011-10-10 12:35:41 +0100","A ""minister"" is really a ""role"" that a ""person"" fulfills.  We want to really clarify the relationships between people and organisations/documents in the system. A Minster is really a person fulfilling a particular role (within an organisation). A Person can have multiple Roles, but we believe that a Role belongs to a single Organisation. We've challenged Neil to provide an example where this isn't true.  There may still be space for ""Minster"" as a higher-level domain object (something encapsulating a particular role and the person currently fulfilling it), but that can be addressed later.","164","4506","2515","27","630","1211","46"

"2011-09-29 15:52:29 +0100","Admins should be able to see when a document has an attachment.  This is important when editing a document, because, unless you can see an existing attachment, you might unintentionally overwrite the existing attachment or submit it to the second pair of eyes without realising it has an attachment.
